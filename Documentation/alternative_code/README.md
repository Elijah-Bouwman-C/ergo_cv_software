# MATLAB Code
- Might require the toolbox here:
  https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/76860-human-pose-estimation-with-deep-learning

- Might also require this for installation
  https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/389223-how-do-i-silently-install-support-packages-in-matlab-r2018a-or-newer#Downloaded

- Highly recommend updating to the latest MATLAB and then using this framework:

# Python Code 
- You are going to need to download the neural network from here (Although I highly recommend using any model from OpenCV)
