# Ergonomics Computer Vision Software 

- This software package is based on opencv-python and mediapipe from Google and is meant to replicate the measurements made by a goniometer
- It takes in a .mp4 or .mov file and then maps a skeleton onto their limbs
- Datapoints are extracted and converted into .csv files
- These csv files can be analyzed in EHS Smart or sent on to an ergonomist



# Future Goals:
- Implement Snowflake API to directly input data
- Implement face blurring (currrently in testing but unstable)
- Improve general user interface
- Develop a gesture detection model
